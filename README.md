# Memory Card Game
## How it's played?
The game includes 12 space-themed card. The goal of the game is to click on each individual card, without clicking on any of it twice. Everytime you click on a card, all cards change positions.It may sound simple, but it has proven to be quite challenging without a bit of practice. 
## How it works?
You have 12 cards which you have to click on. Everytime you click on a card you haven't clicked on before, your score increments by one and the deck shuffles. Everytime you click on a card that you have clicked on before, your score resets to 0. You also have a best score that registers your highest score up to the present moment.
## Techonolgies used:
* JavaScript
* React
* CSS

I have used functional React Components, useState hook and useEffect hook to mimic lifecycle methods.
## How to run the app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```
Or you can simply visit the [live page](https://anabargau.github.io/memory-card/).
## What I learned
I learned how to properly make use of functional components in React, how properly use hooks and their advantages.
